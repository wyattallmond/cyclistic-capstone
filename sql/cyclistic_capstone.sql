/* =============================================================================
Cyclistic Capstone â€” BigQuery SQL
Author: Wyatt Allmond
Project: cyclistic-case-study-468919
Dataset: cyclistic_trips

Purpose:
- Load 12 months of trips, clean anomalies, and build summary tables for analysis.

Key data-quality rules:
- Keep rides where ended_at > started_at
- Remove rides <= 1 minute (accidental unlocks / false starts)
- Remove rides >= 24 hours (system anomalies)
- Keep all stationless (dockless) rides, but exclude NULL station names in "Top Stations"

Outputs:
- Fact table:   cleaned_trips
- Summaries:    summ_member_stats, summ_trips_by_dow, summ_trips_by_month, summ_trips_by_hour,
                summ_rideable_share, summ_top_start_stations, summ_top_end_stations, summ_weekend_split

Run Order:
1) Window raw data
2) Build cleaned data table
3) Sanity checks
4) Build summary data tables
